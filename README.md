# Creative Web Application Proposal!

Hello! 
This is my proposal for a web application.

My web app concept is called *Boxy!* The web app will be based around a physical box which would have a qr code on it. Upon the qr code being scanned, the user would be taken to a map which would showcase where boxy has been before. They would be given the option to make a post about boxy. This post would contain the location boxy is in along with the potential for some text and an image. There would be a couple filters on the map that would show data in different ways (ie: where boxy was this time last year, where boxy was the most). The user would also be able to scroll through the posts/logs from previous users which could also be filtered.

## Existing alternatives and inspirations
The project takes some direct inspiration from a 2010s internet trend, where people would send around an object such as a teddy bear to a friend. This friend would take a picture with it doing something cool then passing it onto a friend of their own, thus creating a cycle where the teddy was sent around the world.
This is a link to an instagram that I have found that is an example of this trend : https://www.instagram.com/teds_world_adventures/.


I did find an existing website that does a couple of similar things to what I am proposing : https://paperplanes.world. Paper planes is built around sending virtual planes to other users and looking at the ones they send out. This is similar to what I am proposing to do as my app will be built around users making posts (like the planes) and then showing the location of where the posts are on a 3d globe! It's very clear that the front end was thought a lot about, and it makes it clear that I do still need to put a bit of consideration into the frontend now as so that the final product will be seamless, as showing data to the user needs to be done in an appealing way as to not turn them off.



## Evidence of explorations
To start the project I did a lot of exploring with what I wanted to do. Unfortunately I don't have many pictures from this stage as I did it before moving house where I accidentally binned a couple pages. To start with I simply came up with as many ideas as I could, then choosing my favourite (as can be seen in the first picture). From here I sketched out the two ideas that were viable and chose my favourite (Boxy!)

I also recieved ideas from a ideation session in class. I have taken a number of these into consideration to add into the project as well.

## How data will be used
The app will store the posts data, such as a username of who made the post and its content. I will also need to store the previous locations that boxy has been. These will be stored in an external database. I will also have to check if the user has opened the website from the qr code as otherwise they should not be able to post about boxy.

I may potentially use user accounts, this is still undecided. 

There is the potential to expand the project more if there is time, as I could add LED’s onto boxy that could be controlled by users on the web page to add more connectivity between the website user and the person who has boxy. 

## Target audience
The target audience of the site would be anyone who has interacted with the physical boxy. The typical user of the web app will tend to be younger people as I feel that they will be able to become more engaged in the project and learn from it. I would be targeting more active people who would be more likely to go out and take pictures of boxy doing interesting things, trying to give them a novel experience they don't get to experience often/ever.


## How the app will provide a novel experience
While the project has been inspired by an old trend that existed previously, I would hope to improve on it and make it a more novel experience as a web app would allow a lot more interactivity. The blending of physical objects with an openly accessible website is hard to find therefore I feel the app is unique. The app will provide an experience that you can't get anywhere else, requiring a physical component to even be able to post, therefore making it a unique take on a social media.
